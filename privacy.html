            Privacy Policy
            DFS Virtual Call Center (“DFS Virtual Call Center,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) values the privacy of the
            individuals who use our technology, websites, and related services (collectively, the “DFS Virtual Call
            Center Website”). This privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and use at DFS
            Virtual Call Center, and the choices you have associated with that information.
            Information We Collect <br><br>

            A. What We Collect
            Device Information. DFS Virtual Call Center receives information from your devices, including IP address,
            location, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application
            installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers, push notification tokens, and, if you
            register with your social media account (such as Facebook, Google or LinkedIn), your applicable social media
            identifier. <br><br>
            Biometric Data. DFS Virtual Call Center may collect, store, use, and derive biometric data from your
            submitted pictures, driver's license, or government-issued ID. DFS Virtual Call Center will use this data to
            confirm your identity from time to time. .
            Service Data (including Session and Usage data). <br><br> To help us understand how you use the DFS Virtual
            Call Center Website and to help us improve it, we automatically receive information about your interactions
            with the DFS Virtual Call Center Website, like the pages or other content you view, your actions within the
            DFS Virtual Call Center Website, and the dates and times of your visits. When you use the DFS Virtual Call
            Center Website, we receive information generated through such use, either entered by you or others who use
            the Website with you (for example, schedules, attendee info, etc.), or from the DFS Virtual Call Center
            Website itself (for example, duration of session, use of webcams, connection information, servicing
            information, etc.). We may also collect usage and log data, including diagnostic data to help us support the
            services. <br><br>
            Call, Email and Text Information. We work with third-party partners to facilitate calls, emails and text
            messages to you. We may receive information about these communications including the date and time of the
            call, email or SMS message, and whether the call was answered or the message was received or opened. We will
            share your information with such partners to facilitate these communications and to help us provide services
            on the DFS Virtual Call Center Website. <br><br>

            for various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies. <br><br>
