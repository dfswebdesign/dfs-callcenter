        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml">What is arise Virtual solutions?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">Arise Virtual Solutions is changing the way companies think about call center services. Arise provides a virtual platform to connect primarily work-at-home service professionals to Fortune 500 and other large companies. <br><br>

          For over two decades, Arise’s platform has enabled superior and extremely flexible customer contact, business processing and consulting solutions for numerous companies around the globe, uniquely blending crowd-sourcing innovation, virtual technology and operational efficiency’s to deliver an enhanced customer experience for a company’s customers. <br><br>

      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml">Who is dfs virtual Callcenter?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">As a Partner of Arise Virtual Platform, we operate as a Virtual Call Center (Recruiting Agency) and we are excited to offer you the opportunity to join our growing team as a Client Support Professional (CSP). 

          Since Arise business model is Business to Business, it means agents are not employees of Arise nor of DFS Virtual Call Center.  Instead, DFS acts as the middleman that allows you to gain access to the Arise platform as n Independent Contractor.  
          
          What we do is simply provide you with a business opportunity to be your own boss, set your own hours and work in the comfort of your home.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml ">How much do I get paid</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">The pay rate can vary depending on the client you choose to work. Current agents are taking home incomes of $8.00 - $14.00+ per hour as a base rate. There is no limit to how much you can make. <br><br> You select the number of hours you want, the more you work , the more you make.  Some clients do provide incentives if a high quality score is maintained.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml">Are there any recurring fees?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">We have a low flat service fee of $35 per pay invoice in addition to the fee our partner (Arise Virtual Solution) charges which is $19.75. We pay our independent contractors on the 15th and 30th of each month. GET PAID EXACTLY WHAT IS PAID BY THE CLIENT!  <br><br>

          As a company, we have to cover business costs including Partner fee’s, computers, bank fees, software costs, direct deposit fee’s and more. Our low, flat service fee allows us to provide you with support during your certification process and beyond. We want you to succeed! <br><br>     
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title">Why should I pay for certification?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">This is the MOST common question asked among individuals such as yourself, especially in today’s society.  <br><br>

          As an Independent contractor, we are not responsible for the equipment and/or schooling costs associated with becoming certified for the client opportunity. By doing so, it cross’s the line between Contractor VS Employee which is against the law and policy however, we do offer ‘Give Away(s)’ for a chance to win coupons (vouchers) and have your certification fee reduced or paid for.  <br><br>
          
          As an Independent Contractor with DFS Virtual Call Center you are allowed to:  <br><br>
          1.  Work for multiple clients in multiple departments.
          2.  Use your own tools and equipment that best fit your personal needs.
          3.  Set your own scheduled hours to work around your lifestyle.
          4.  Service under our business license without having to purchase your own.
          5.  Bypass the annual business fees, taxes, insurance, and more as listed in the last fact of this page “CSP vs IBO”.
          6.  Take time off from contracted services for vacation when you desire.
          (You may take up to 3 consecutive weeks off from services while under contract at a time).
          7.  Another Common Example to Explain  <br><br>
           
          Many of us know what a CNA is, otherwise known as a Certified Nursing Assistant.  <br><br>
          As a CNA, individuals must complete required schooling associated with becoming a Certified Nursing Assistance by enrolling with a local community college for a 1-3 month course, thus you must have proper transportation and/or babysitter arrangements to attend.
          The course may vary anywhere from $200 to $500 plus registration, exam, and/or equipment fee(s).  <br>
          At the end of your course you are required to complete hands on activities with live patients. Once you have successfully passed this and your final exam, you are given your Certificate of Completion allowing you to apply for careers in your area if there are openings.​ <br><br>
          NOTE: Paying for the CNA course and successfully completing this does not guarantee you a future job as a Nursing Assistance unlike our agents. <br><br>
          What is the difference?  <br><br>
          As a CSP, also known as a Customer Service Professional, you would:  <br><br>
          Enroll with one of our positions listed HERE and complete the 2-4 week online certification with a LIVE instructor who will be using a webcam, thus no need for transportation and/or babysitters.  <br><br>
          The course’s vary from $9.99 - $19.99, ALL course’s include the cost of books, programs, and systems needed.  <br><br>
          Some may include equipment such as a webcam, T-shirt, backdrop, and USB stick (if it’s needed for that particular position).
          At the end of your course you are required to complete a mock call (practice call) from your own home using your land line. Once you successfully complete the course you are GUARANTEED the position.  <br><br>
          You may begin taking live calls and generating an income that very next day!  <br><br>
          Do I have to pay for this course more than once?  <br><br>
          No, the course is a one time fee. All upskill courses are free once you begin taking live calls. This includes the background check.
          If you were to quit and not service for more than 30 days you will be required to re-take/re-pay for the course to come back.
          There is a maintenance fee of only $40.00 each pay period for program/system specific platform usage in order to work from home with the company.  <br><br>
           
          How will this fee affect me exactly?  <br>
          Example:  <br><br>
           
          John Doe completed his cable certification and began servicing live calls last month.
          He wants to work at least 40 hours each week and the past two weeks he worked a total of 82 hours. His position starts at $11.00 per hour and he hopes to excel and move up within the client to make up to $14.00 per hour one day.  <br><br>
           
          82 hours X $11.00 per hour = $902.00  <br><br>
          ​
          After the maintenance fee, John Doe will pocket $862.00 that pay period.
          If he worked the same amount of time for the whole month,  <br><br>
           
          JOHN DOE WILL POCKET A TOTAL OF $1,724.00 ​FOR THAT MONTH!

      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml">How Much Can I Earn?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">Your compensation can be as little or as big as you make it. You choose the client that you want to service. Some choose their client for the compensation rate only. Some choose a client because they offer 24 hours services and some choose a client that is super easy with less hourly pay. You set your own schedule and choose when and how much you work. <br><br>

          Your paycheck is up to you! <br><br>
          
          We have team members making between $200 – $1300+ bi-weekly! We also have members that are servicing multiple clients, so again what you earn is 100% up to you.

      </div>

      <div class="accordion__item">
        <h3 class="accordion__title js-title u-margin-bottom-sml">Am I an employee of of DFS Virtual Solutions?</h3>
        <p class="accordion__copy accordion__copy--open js-copy ">No, you are not an employee of DFS nor Arise Virtual Solutions.
