 I just completed this website project, which took me about 2 weeks, with my already busy schedule. The website created is for my existing business, however it was long overdue for a new and modern feel using the newer technologies...No not React-Js. Originally it was built with WordPress and WordPress themes and plugins. I know, its the lazy way of building a website in just a day, but it was also built back in 2017. :)

So I went away from the traditional way of building the site with normal html and css. Instead, I implemented the BEM model ( Block Element Modifier) which allowed me to build the site with different components, so instead of having one huge file, it was compartmentalized.

Next, I used Sass, which just an extension to the CSS language. Now, in order to compile SASS into CSS code, I used a compiler. This now introduces the whole new world of the NPM eco system.
